                    <h3>NIGHTWISH ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST REACTED TO BANDS!
                        :|APRIL 19, 2022|:</h3><br>
                        <p>Among the most popular videos on YouTube are the so-called reaction videos, where YouTubers around the world describe their own reactions when watching TV series, movie trailers or music videos and live recordings of different artists and bands. The videos show a wide range of genuine and spontaneous emotions from the reactors which makes the reaction videos popular.<br><br>
        
                        Almost all of the music-themed reaction channels have at least one Nightwish-themed video. Nightwish is one of the most watched bands, according to the numbers, which makes us one of the bands with the most reaction videos in the world on YouTube. The other bands that share the top spot with Nightwish include South Korean kpop band BTS and Japanese metal band BABYMETAL.<br><br>
                        
                        "Ghost Love Score" has the most reaction videos, with 1,400 different reaction videos and over 18 million views. And next week we are standing on the stage again in Finland!</p>

                        :|FEBRUARY 3, 2022|:</h3><br>
                    <p>On March 11 Nightwish releases the first night of the virtual event "An Evening With Nightwish in a     Virtual World" at the Islanders Arms on DVD!. <br>

                        When Nightwish’s world tour was canceled due to the pandemic, the band wanted to offer fans something unprecedented. Half a year in preparation they put together an exceptionally ambitious production, the like of which had not been seen before. Fans were able to follow the band playing live in the astonishing 3D world, designed according to the band’s vision, while interacting with each other. Also, songs from Nightwish’s latest album ‘Human. : II: Nature.’ were played live for the first time. <br>
                        
                        “This is definitely one of the coolest things Nightwish has ever done. Entwining visual elements, technology and music in such an extraordinary way offers an unique experience to us all”, the band states. <br>
                        
                        ‘An Evening with Nightwish in a Virtual World’ concert streamed last year across 108 countries to over 150,000 viewers. The much awaited show, set in a 3D world, will be finally available in dvd format. Order yours now! <br>
